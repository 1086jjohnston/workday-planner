# Work Day Scheduler

This is an hourly work day scheduler which utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. You can enter a task at a given hour and the task will be save. Moment.js helps the app check the current time to refresh the hour of the day in real-time. Past hours are grey, current hour is red, upcoming hours are green. When you refresh the page, your tasks (previous, current, & upcoming) will be saved.
